# Volga

Volga is a Vaadin add-on that helps you to add meta data to your Vaadin applications, which will help social media services and search engines better interpret your application.

*Download release versions via [vaadin.com/directory](https://vaadin.com/directory)*.

The add-on is in its early stages so expect some changes to its API in the future. All input is highly appreciated, preferably via github issues. 

Currently it supports following meta tags:

 * basic "description" meta tag
 * twitter cards
 * open graph meta information

It is highly suggested that you use it with [the History add-on](https://vaadin.com/directory#!addon/history), which makes it possible to serve different meta tags for different views of your applications. See [the demo project](https://github.com/mstahv/volga/tree/master/volga-example) for a usage example.
